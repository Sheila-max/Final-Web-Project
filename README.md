# Final-Web-Project

Ever wanted to go out but you don't know where to go? or Ever wanted to go to a new place and take adventures with food but you don't know where
to begin?
Kumbehe is a web service that provides ideas for restaurants to eat from when you donâ€™t know where exactly to go. 
With Kumbehe you get a first hand knowledge of these restaurants before you even get to see them in person. 
You will be able to see the most highlighted features of a particular restaurant and what people who have been there recommend about the place.
